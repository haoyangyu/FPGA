Software/hardware Embedded System_Rutgers
====

This is the repository for the labs of Software/hardware Embedded System in Fall, 2013, Rutgers. All the codes are written by VHDL, which is the hardware description language: VHSIC Hardware Description Language. 

Despite the fact that some codes are easy, but the repository shows what I had done in that class. For the readers, may be you can use these to learn by yourself.
